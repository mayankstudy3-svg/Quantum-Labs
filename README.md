# 🚀 Quantum Labs

**Quantum Labs** is my personal research and development workspace — a place where ideas turn into prototypes, systems get tested in the real world, and engineering discipline meets curiosity.

This space documents my journey across:
**UAVs • RC Aircraft • Transmitters • Embedded Systems • Electronics Engineering • Experimental Prototyping**

## 🎯 Engineering Philosophy
**Think → Build → Test → Improve → Repeat**

✔️ Practical over theoretical  
✔️ Clean documentation, not clutter  
✔️ Failures are learning assets, not trash to hide  
✔️ Quality > Quantity
