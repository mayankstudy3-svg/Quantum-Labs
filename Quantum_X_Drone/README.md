# Quantum X — Experimental Micro Drone

Quantum X is a lightweight experimental drone platform focused on efficient coreless propulsion and stable real-world flight performance.

**Firmware:** Custom ESP-based control stack with iterative tuning  
**Motors:** 8520 coreless motors 
**Thrust:** Capable of producing >2× aircraft weight (tests vary by prop + battery)  
**AUW:** ~64 g (current build, evolving with optimizations)  
**Top Speed:** 30Km/h (speed may vary from setup to setup) 
**Design Goal:** Reliable, lightweight, modular, and cleanly engineered

More flight data, logs, and refinements coming as the platform evolves.
